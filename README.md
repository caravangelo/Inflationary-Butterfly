# File description

This repository contains animations of the simulation presented in arXiv:??????

There are three animations, one for each case presented in the paper, corresponding to: case 1 (perturbative), case 2 (highly non-perturbative), case 3 (non-perturbative). 

The left panel of the animation shows 2D snapshots of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N$. The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of inflaton field values across the simulation.

## Setup 1: perturbative
