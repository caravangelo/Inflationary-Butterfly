# Animations

This repository contains animations of the simulation presented in arXiv:2403.12811 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811)

There are three animations, one for each case presented in the paper.

The left panel of the animation shows 2D snapshots of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N$. The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of inflaton field values across the simulation, overlapped with a plot of the potential (green). For definitions and notations, please see the paper.

## Setup 1: perturbative

On the left, we can see structures in the inflaton field changing size and position before settling down. On the right, the distribution of values follows our perturbative intuition: the inflaton is a very sharp distribution of values, and quantum fluctuations remain small.

## Setup 2: highly non-perturbative

This time the situation is different: while at the first the dynamics is similar to the one above, the situation soon changes: flucuations grow large, and consequently the Universe gets stuck inside the oscillatory part of the potential. Inflation last forever in this setup, and this is due only to the presence of the tiny initial quantum fluctuations.

## Setup 3: non-perturbative

In this mixed situation, only some regions of the Universe get stuck. These regions are shown in red during the last part of the simulation. After the end of inflation, these regions will become black holes from the point of view of an outside observer. From the inside, they are forever expanding parallel Universes.
