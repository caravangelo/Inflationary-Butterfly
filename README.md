# File description

The left panel of the animation shows 2D snapshots of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N$. 

The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of inflaton field values across the simulation.

There are three animations, corresponding to: case 1 (perturbative), case 2 (highly non-perturbative), case 3 (non-perturbative).
