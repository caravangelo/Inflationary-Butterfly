The left panel of the animation shows a 2D snapshot of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N_e$ in reduced Planck mass units $M_{\rm Pl}$ =1. 

The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of $\delta\phi=\phi-\langle\phi\rangle$, still in reduced Planck mass units.
