# Animations

This repository contains animations of the simulation presented in arXiv:2403.12811 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811).

There are three animations, each corresponding to a case presented in the paper.

The left panel of the animation shows 2D snapshots of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-fold time $N$. The right panel displays the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of inflaton field values across the simulation, overlapped with a plot of the potential (in green). For definitions and notations, please refer to the paper.

## Setup 1: perturbative

On the left, we can observe structures in the inflaton field changing size and position over time until they settle into their final configuration. On the right, the probability density function (PDF) matches the perturbative intuition: the inflaton exhibits a sharply peaked distribution of values, and quantum fluctuations remain small throughout the simulation.

## Setup 2: highly non-perturbative

This time, the situation is different. During the first few $e$-folds of evolution, the dynamics resemble those above, with perturbations remaining small. However, the situation soon changes: fluctuations grow large and become comparable to the wavelength of the oscillatory potential, causing the Universe to get stuck inside the feature. Inflation lasts forever in this setup. Importantly, without the small initial quantum fluctuations, this would not happen, and the inflaton would be able to escape the oscillatory part of the potential.

## Setup 3: non-perturbative

In this mixed situation, only some regions of the Universe get stuck. These regions are shown in red during the last part of the simulation. After the end of inflation, these regions will become black holes from the point of view of an outside observer. From the inside, they are forever-expanding parallel universes.
