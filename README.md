### File description

The left panel of the animation shows a 2D snapshot of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N_e$ in reduced Planck mass units $M_{\rm Pl}$ =1. 

The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of $\delta\phi=\phi-\langle\phi\rangle$, still in reduced Planck mass units.

There are three animations, corresponding to case A, B and C presented in [ref] as given by the filename.

Here is a description of what is happening in these three cases:

# Case A

In case A, blabla

# Case B

In case B, blabla

# Case C
