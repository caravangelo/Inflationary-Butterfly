# Animations

This repository contains animations of the simulation presented in arXiv:2403.12811 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811)

There are three animations, one for each case presented in the paper.

The left panel of the animation shows 2D snapshots of the inflaton field $\phi$ as a function of e-folds time $N$. The right panel shows the 1-point probability density function (PDF) of inflaton field values across the simulation, overlapped with a plot of the potential (green).

## Setup 1: perturbative

On the left, we can see structures in the inflaton field changing size and position before settling down. On the right, the distribution of values follows our perturbative intuition: the inflaton is a very sharp distribution of values, and quantum fluctuations remain small.

## Setup 2: highly non-perturbative
